// sobol_21k_scrambled
//
// A modification of sobol_21k.cp to include the scrambling of the sequence
// to improve the randomness in 2-dimensional cross-sections.
//
// See scrambed_sobol.c for more information on the scrambling algorithm used
// and its implementation here. --Paul Lujan, August 2017

// The points should be generated ONE POINT AT A TIME and cleared from memory immediately after the associated// function evaluation is finished.
